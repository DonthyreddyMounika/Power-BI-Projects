-- Total Bookings
Booking Count = COUNT('Bookings'[BookingID])

-- Cancellation Percentage
Cancellation Pct = 
DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('Bookings'[BookingID]), 'Bookings'[Status] = "Cancelled"),
       COUNT('Bookings'[BookingID]))

-- Total Revenue
Total Revenue = SUM('Bookings'[Revenue])

-- Total Room Nights
Total Room Nights = SUM('Bookings'[RoomNights])

-- Average Room Rate
Avg Room Rate = 
DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Total Room Nights])

-- Booking Lead Time Bucket (Created via calculated column or Power Query buckets)
How far away bucket = SWITCH(TRUE(),
    'Bookings'[LeadTime] <= 7, "1. Before a week",
    'Bookings'[LeadTime] <= 14, "2. Before 2 weeks",
    'Bookings'[LeadTime] <= 21, "3. Before 3 weeks",
